# Node.js Clustering Example

This repository demonstrates how to scale a Node.js app across all CPU cores using the built-in [`cluster`](https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html) module.

## What‚Äôs Inside

‚úÖ Simple clustered HTTP server  
‚úÖ Clustered Express app  
‚úÖ Automatic worker restart on crash  
‚úÖ Minimal production-friendly example  
‚úÖ Graceful shutdown pattern (coming soon)

## Motivation

Node.js runs in a **single thread**, but modern CPUs have multiple cores.

By using clustering:
- You can handle more concurrent requests
- You utilize all CPU cores
- You increase app resiliency (one worker can crash without bringing the whole app down)

## How to Run

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/erickne/node-cluster.git
cd node-cluster
````

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
# or
npm install
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the clustered app

```bash
yarn start
yarn start-express
```

üëâ Now visit: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

You‚Äôll see responses from different worker processes (watch the `process.pid`).

---

## How It Works

* The **primary process** forks workers (1 per CPU core)
* Workers each run their own Node.js process + HTTP server
* OS distributes connections across workers
* Primary process watches for worker exits and restarts them if needed

---

## Limitations / Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è No shared in-memory state between workers
‚ö†Ô∏è Each worker is a full Node process ‚Üí more memory used
‚ö†Ô∏è Graceful shutdown is important (especially for deploys / rolling updates)
